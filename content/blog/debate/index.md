As the philosopher Wikipedia once said:

> Debate is a process that involves formal discussion on a particular topic. In a debate, opposing arguments are put forward to argue for opposing viewpoints. Debate occurs in public meetings, academic institutions, and legislative assemblies.

I am not a professional debater, but I sat already in meetings. Too many of them in fact. So what I know is, if you start to question someone's point of view, you better have some nice arguments ready.

The thing is, I really don't know the answer to all the questions and I never claim to. So why do we assume that, if "A" questions "B"s point of view, that "A" automatically means to pick up his duelists sword and want to start a fight over "B"s position? What if "A" just tries to understand _why_ this point of view is valid, by proving it to himself and others? Maybe "A" does not even have a position other than "I don't understand yet, why that would be true. Please explain this to me". What if by questioning and testing this hypothesis, it turns out, that there was a mistake or the solution is not complete? Would this not lead us closer to the truth?

For me its less about having a position and I certainly do not want to identify myself with an idea and feel bad, when people challenge it (and therefore me!). It's more about looking at different solutions to a problem and testing them all about truthiness. No ego involved and no hard feelings. Like this, we would actually place more value to the truth and less value to our own hurt feelings. We could simply follow the logic and work together. We could spend less energy on "being right" and more on "finding the right thing".

This sounds super easy, but it's not. You need to not only know, that it's bad to identify yourself with such things, it's also a habit that you need to have to first find these attachments and then also let them go. I think, I am going to write about this "letting go"-stuff in a later entry, too ❤️

##### So how do I need to come around and make my position clear?

I wonder, if I need to explain myself at first. Like...

> I don't necessarily disagree with you, but let me challenge your point of view.

Not all people are open to be challenged, but maybe an opening like this could lead to a more relaxed atmosphere. I wish, I could simply transfer the default, that people don't need to identify themselves with an opinion or standpoint and that they know, that I come in peace! But I cannot change the world like that. In this situation, it is probably wise to lead by example.
