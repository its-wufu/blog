description: Oh nice, Chris has a new blog post!
---

## Hi

I'm Chris. I work as a software developer in Berlin. But I think this is not super important. More important is, I want to sort my thoughts and I think this format might be nice!

Also important is, how I develop myself. How I improve my mindset and how I try to improve my little world.

I'm reading a lot and overall have a lot of input. This is great, and from now on I can have also some output here. I will talk about whatever I want but my interests are for example (in no order what so ever):

- Japan
- Technology (AI / Cryptos / React)
- Psychology
- Meditation
- Movies / Series / Anime
- Making the world better
- Stock Market

So now you can have a rough picture, of what this is going to be about.. maybe.

On my last website, I was already starting to talk about things, but I didn't really follow up on that.

The last things were about

> I saw this documentary "THE SOCIAL DILEMMA" about the psychology of social media. And I wish more people would be aware of this. Here is the [Trailer on Youtube](https://youtu.be/rvg0eY_Ls4Y 'Click me, this is a link.')

and

> It is so much easier to help someone else, than to help yourself. But in the end: "Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems, is to help someone else" ~ Uncle Iroh
>
> I was helping others, by creating a WordPress Website: [OASA](https://oasa.berlin/ 'Click me, this is a link.')

I am looking forward to share my thoughts!
