This is not about me saying "Money = bad" or "Money = good". I think money is just a tool and as always, it's up to us, what we are doing with it.

## The Problem

Money is the biggest and mightiest tool, that humans ever created. The whole planet is ruled by it. As a single human, you can not be a part of anything, without also playing the money game. You can not create beautiful things that would help people, without money. You cannot be a scientist and save lives, without money. Even humanity as a whole thinks about money, when we need to tackle a global pandemic or a climate catastrophe. If there is no money to save the planet, we would simply just die.

So what does that have to do with pirates? This is one of the problems, that living under the money system brings with it. This system puts profit on the top of our value system - even over morale or compassion. If something is profitable, someone is going to do it. Even if this would destroy the lives of many others. (To get a reality check, you might want to look into the new Netflix Series "Rotten").

### The Pirate Bird

In nature, between (non human) animals, there is this law of balance between pirate animals and animals that gather resources and create things. Lets imagine a type of bird. If there are many productive birds of this type in an area, it becomes super profitable to just steal from other birds, than to bother gathering on your own, right? Everyone is busy gathering resources, it becomes harder to get your own resources than to simply steal from other birds.
The other way around is true as well. If there are too many pirate birds, it is really hard to find someone to steal from and you have a lot of competitor pirate birds, who could be faster than you. So it becomes really easier to just gather the resource manually.

### The Human

Ok but we are no birds, right? Right? But why? What do we have in place, that these birds don't have? Maybe it's the society and the law. But what happens, if the law does not hold us back? Would we simply get on the streets and burn down cars and raid public places? I think the year 2020 showed us, that if we feel threatened enough, the law is not strong enough to hold us back. Sadly I think, desperate people are not very much different than these birds.
You might say "Yes, but these people are crazy, I would never do that." That might be true and you are maybe one of the few people, that would really sacrifice themselves for the greater good. But maybe you just think like that, because you never really were desperate enough. Maybe you always had enough to not feel the anxiety of not being able to feed your children or yourself.

## The Learning

So what's the morale of this blog entry? I really don't want to have a just dark entry without some suggestions to make things better.
I think there are two things that need to change, so that we can survive this money system.

### 1. We need a new system...

I honestly think, this is not going to work. We cannot create a beautiful world, if its more profitable to destroy the world. People are not thinking long term. If the world explodes in 100 years, I can still make a quick buck and make the world a bit worse, than yesterday. This is how it is sadly.

##### The choice

If there are two scientists. One who offers to research a way to make the cows happier and healthier. The other scientist can research to make the cow produce more milk. No matter how the cow likes it or not.
You can imagine that, if you are an investor, you would rather give the money to someone that promises you to create more money with it. So the money will flow to the scientist that promises more milk, instead of the scientist that promises happier cows.
This choice is made every day and not only for cows, you can imagine.

I think I made my point. So instead of following the money, we need a system to follow whatever we as humanity want to have as highest values. This is to be decided and maybe even through science! So instead a money system, we could have a science system, that tells us, what would be the best course of action to create a better world according to science.

### 2. Politicians are not needed.

We have scientists! Is there actually any reason we need them? I really can't think of any. Lets get rid of this profession please.

I think, he might be on to something. Also I really believe that we can replace the whole concept of politics with science. Like that we would very likely find a much better way to rule the world, than through money.
